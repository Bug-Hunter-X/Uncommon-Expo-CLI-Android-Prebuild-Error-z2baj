The solution involves a multi-pronged approach to diagnose the root cause of the Android build failure during `expo prebuild`.  Here's a JavaScript example outlining checks and solutions:

// 1. Check Gradle Version:
//   Ensure compatibility with your Expo SDK version.  Refer to Expo's documentation for guidance.

// 2. Resolve Dependency Conflicts:
//   Carefully review your package.json and look for conflicting dependency versions. 
//   Use tools such as `npm-check-updates` to identify outdated packages.

// 3. Verify Android SDK Setup:
//   Make sure the Android SDK command-line tools, build-tools, and platform-tools are correctly installed and configured.
//   You can use the Android Studio SDK Manager to verify.

// 4. Clean Build:
//   Use `expo prebuild --clean` to delete the existing build cache.  A clean build helps identify problems stemming from previous failed builds.

// 5. Inspect Gradle Build Logs:
//   Examine the Gradle logs for detailed error messages.  These logs usually provide crucial clues about the problem's origin.
//   The log location varies based on the operating system and Expo setup.

// Example snippet to demonstrate a potential problem (this may not directly fix the issue but shows where to look):

// In your Android project (usually in `android/app/build.gradle`)
// Ensure dependencies are correctly specified and compatible.
//  ... other Gradle settings ... 
//   dependencies {
//       implementation "some-package:1.0.0"
//       implementation "another-package:2.0.0" // potential conflict?
//   }
//  ... other Gradle settings ...
```
